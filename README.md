# Proper_Loan_Data_Analysys
In this project I have analyzed the loan data set from the peer to peer lending company - Prosper. This loan data set contains about 100000+ observations over 80+ variables.
The data spans over about a decade - 2005 through 2014 and is a good reflection of the lending industry as it existed across the downturn around 2009.
The analysis starts with a large number of exploration to get a feel of what variables I will be interested about to have more deep dive on. After narrowing dowing a set of interesting variables, I carried on bivariate and multivariate analysis to gain more insight into the data and possible correlation among the variables.
Creating a model to predict some outcome, e.g. borrower's APR or future loan status (will be defaulted or not) would be interesting. However, I must admit that this was beyond my capability at this point and am looking forward to learning those skills in immediate future.
This project has been conducted entirely in R with assistance from Udacity for guidance and reviews.
